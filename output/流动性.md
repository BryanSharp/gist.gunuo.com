## 流动性

- 流动性的初始含义是一样东西的变现能力。比如我们常用的变现天数。但现在我们更多的用它来说明市场行为。

- 这个概念最容易理解的例子是每个城市的房地产变现天数。当市场下行时，变现天数显著增长，大家会说，不好了，这个城市的库存还需要60个月才能消化。当市场好起来的时候，大家又欢喜的发现，这个城市的库存只剩下8个月。变现天数本身是一个动态的数据。它不是一个稳定可靠的数据。但却是我们观察市场行为的一个特点。

他说，金融创新意味着流动性的创造已经脱离了联储的控制。
过去150年来的3次典型的信用创造周期。
* 1. 从1865年到1913年，银行家的决定来支配着信用周期，那时信用就等于银行家愿意出借的数量。换句话说，银行保留多少准备金是由银行家对他所开展的生意的审慎感觉相关的。在那个时期，银行的恐慌阵痛是经常发生的，比如1873年，1893年和1907年。为了应对这种恐慌，1913年最终推出了联邦基金法，并创造了银行系统，联储随即控制了支撑整个银行系统负债所需的贮备数量，随后就相应制造或收回了流动性。
* 联储对流动性的控制提供了金融稳定性。尽管大多数市场参与者在学校里都学了凯恩斯经济学，但这只提供了就业、利息和金钱的一个理论。有唱反调的奥地利经济学派解释历史比凯恩斯更好一些。奥地利经济学派的Von Mises和哈亚克都质疑流动性引发了通胀，但不是所有的价格都同步上涨。实际上，资本品首先被影响，带来了超额利润和经济的这个板块的股票价格上涨。在这个阶段，消费品价格是稳定的，甚至是下跌的。

 Lee Thomas prefers to step back and redefine terms to understand better exactly what people mean by liquidity. offers cautious words about the Federal Reserve's ability to control liquidity.


Where non-Austrian economists were optimistic during the 1920s, rejecting the idea that liquidity was too abundant by pointing to stable inflation, many Austrian economists were predicting it would all end in tears.

"Events today are evolving as they would in an Austrian world, when liquidity is too abundant," says Mr Thomas.

Recent years mark the third period in this historical construct, according to Mr Thomas. Here two considerations arise: first, for the Austrians, goods price inflation is a late cycle event - asset price inflation comes first; and second, liquidity is being created outside the banking system.

Mr Thomas explains that today, instead of holding assets until maturity, banks sell their assets to be securitised, meaning that debt markets have usurped bank credit, and the Fed has been effectively removed from the picture.

"Debt creation depends on the quantity that securitised debt investors [not bankers] deem prudent to hold. Liquidity - the ability to create debt and the associated assets - is effectively unregulated, just as it was before 1913," says Mr Thomas.

And securitisation is not the only innovation that has reduced the Fed's ability to control liquidity. Derivatives are another. Consider the position of investors who want to own stocks in a leveraged way.

They once had only two choices, both of which were regulated. They could borrow from a bank and invest the proceeds in the stock market, or they could use margin. In either case, regulations held the investorsin check.

Today, instead of borrowing from a bank, a potential leveraged equity investor can simply buy an equity futures contract or enter into a total return swap, and a bond investor can enter a swap agreement or buy bond and note futures.

"As innovation has greased the machine, so to speak, the Fed has given up control in the process," says Mr Thomas.

Arguably, he says, if the Fed controls only one of the levers that can manipulate credit creation, it will have to push or pull that lever more firmly than it would if the slightest touch had a more substantial effect.

"In such a world, we can expect the Fed funds rate to be manipulated more often and with greater vigour than it has been in the past," says Mr Thomas.

"It is difficult to ignore the fact that the last time the Fed stimulated the economy, it felt the need to lower the funds rate dramatically."

He concedes that in the past he would have applauded the idea that regulation of the credit creation process had passed from public to private hands. The invisible hand, he thought, would be better than the iron fist of regulation.

"But experience and history convince me that markets are manic depressive, veering from too much optimism to too much pessimism," says Mr Thomas.

"Because commercial banks no longer control credit creation and the Fed no longer even effectively controls commercial banks, expect financial markets to increasingly resemble casinos. This is how Keynes, himself a successful speculator and an early global macro player, described them," he adds.
